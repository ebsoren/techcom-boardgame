1. Safety vs. Schedule Pressure ⏳
Scenario
You are the lead engineer on a new pedestrian bridge project. During the final inspection, your team discovers a critical structural flaw in a key supporting beam that could lead to collapse under high stress (e.g., during a severe storm or a major public event). Fixing the flaw will require a two-month delay and significantly increase the project cost, incurring a $2 million penalty as per the contract. Your project manager urges you to sign off, arguing that the flaw is likely minor and the chance of failure is statistically low, pressuring you not to jeopardize the company's reputation and finances.
Responses and Points

Ethical Evaluation
Points
Response A: Immediately halt construction/opening and formally report the critical flaw to the client and your company's senior management. Recommend the necessary redesign and repair, documenting all findings.
Excellent. Upholds the primary ethical duty to protect the public safety and welfare, regardless of cost or schedule.
+10
Response B: Agree to sign off on the structure, but secretly draft a letter to your superior and the client after the fact, documenting your concerns and assigning liability to the construction team/project manager.
Poor. You knowingly allow a dangerous structure to open, violating public trust. The documentation is an inadequate, self-serving attempt to dodge responsibility.
-5
Response C: Conduct a second, independent, and thorough analysis with a different team to verify the criticality of the flaw before making a final decision, but keep the initial findings confidential for now.
Fair. It shows a commitment to certainty (due diligence) but risks delaying the necessary safety action and potentially covers up the initial finding temporarily.

2. Whistleblowing on Environmental Non-Compliance 🌳
Scenario
You are a chemical engineer working for a manufacturing plant. You discover that your company is routinely dumping untreated wastewater into a nearby river late at night, in violation of local and federal environmental regulations, to save money on treatment costs. You first report this to your immediate supervisor, who tells you to "mind your own business" and that "everyone does it." You know this pollution is harming the local ecosystem and potentially the downstream water supply.
Responses and Points
Response
Ethical Evaluation
Points
Response A: Resign immediately, citing the company's unethical and illegal practices in your exit interview, but take no further action.
Poor. While you refuse to participate, you fail in the professional duty to protect the public and stop an ongoing illegal act.
-2
Response B: Follow the company's internal reporting chain (even if it's resistant) and, if no action is taken, anonymously report the violation with documented evidence to the relevant environmental protection agency.
Excellent. Follows the chain of command first, then fulfills the duty to the public interest by escalating the matter to external authorities.
+10
Response C: Continue working but discreetly gather evidence (photos, internal memos, test results) and use it to threaten your supervisor into changing the practice and giving you a promotion/raise.
Bad. Using the discovery for personal gain constitutes extortion and an abuse of professional position.

3. Data Integrity and Client Trust 📈
Scenario
You are a data scientist hired by a tech startup to validate the performance claims of their new AI-powered investment software. You find that the software's claimed 90% accuracy rate is actually closer to 65% and that the published marketing results have been significantly "cherry-picked" and manipulated. The CEO informs you that the company is about to close a major funding round based on these inflated metrics and that revealing the truth would bankrupt the company.

4. Conflict of Interest and Bidding 💸
Scenario
You are a senior civil engineer involved in reviewing bids for a major municipal water project. Your sibling's construction company submits a bid that is technically sound and slightly lower than the next competitor. You have not disclosed your familial relationship because you believe you can remain objective. Another engineer raises a question about the relationship, and you realize you should have disclosed it earlier.
Responses and Points

7. Exploiting Developing World Labor Laws 🌍
Scenario
You are designing a high-tech electronic device. Your manufacturing partner suggests moving the assembly line to a country with significantly laxer labor laws and minimal environmental regulations, which would save your company 40% in production costs. This move would involve hiring employees at below-standard wages and generating much more local pollution than is legal in your home country.
Responses and Points
Response
Ethical Evaluation
Points
Response A: Proceed with the move, arguing that your primary responsibility is to the company's shareholders (fiduciary duty) and that local labor laws are the responsibility of the host country's government, not yours.
Poor. While legally permissible in that country, it ignores the professional ethical duty to consider the societal and environmental impacts of engineering work globally.
-5
Response B: Insist on a clause in the manufacturing contract that mandates the assembly plant adhere to your home country's labor and environmental standards (or equivalent high standards), even if it reduces the cost savings.
Excellent. Integrates global social responsibility and environmental stewardship into the engineering process.
+9
Response C: Recommend a different country that offers cost savings but has moderately better (but still not great) labor and environmental standards than the proposed option.
Fair. It's a compromise that shows awareness but doesn't fully address the ethical concerns of seeking the lowest possible standard.

10. Prioritizing Accessibility ♿
Scenario
You are designing a public-facing web application for a government service. The client has explicitly requested that you skip implementing accessibility features (like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and high contrast modes) because they consider it a non-essential feature and want to launch two months sooner, saving the project $50,000. Implementing these features is a standard best practice but not strictly required by the contract.
Responses and Points
Response
Ethical Evaluation
Points
Response A: Skip the features, noting that you are only obligated to fulfill the contract terms as written and the client made the final decision.
Bad. You fail in the duty to ensure that your work benefits and is accessible to all segments of the population, especially those with disabilities.
-10
Response B: Strongly advise the client in writing that skipping accessibility features creates a significant barrier for users with disabilities and recommend delaying the launch to include them, offering a cost-saving solution for implementation.
